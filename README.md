# rofi-clipster
## A rofi frontend for [clipster](https://github.com/mrichar1/clipster)

[Clipster](https://github.com/mrichar1/clipster) is a very nice clipboard manager, but the rofi frontend [roficlip](https://github.com/gilbertw1/roficlip) looks abandoned. Thus, `rofi-clipster`.

## Installation
### From releases
1. Download the wheel file.
2. Call `pip install <rofi-clipster.wheel>`.

### Manually
1. Download `clippy/Clippy.py`.
2. Execute it.

## Why should I use it?
If you like `clipster` and `rofi`, it's worth a try. Plus, it tries to be faster than `roficlip`.
